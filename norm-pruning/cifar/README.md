# CIFAR Experiments

This directory contains the CIFAR experiments for norm-based pruning including:

1. [L1-norm based channel pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08710)
2. [Non-structured weight-level pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626)

For each method, we give example commands for baseline training, finetuning.
